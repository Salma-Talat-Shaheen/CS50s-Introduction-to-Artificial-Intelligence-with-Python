# Traffic Sign Recognition AI Project

## Overview

This project aims to build an AI model that can identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph. Using TensorFlow, we will create a neural network to classify road signs based on images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. This dataset contains thousands of images across 43 different categories of road signs.

The neural network model will be trained and evaluated to predict the type of traffic sign from images, and it will be capable of classifying images into one of the predefined categories based on the road sign depicted in the image.

## Background

As self-driving car technology evolves, one critical challenge in ensuring safe navigation is teaching machines to recognize traffic signs. This project tackles that challenge using a neural network to recognize traffic signs from images. By building and training the model, the AI will be able to classify road signs such as stop signs, speed limits, and yield signs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (recommended for compatibility with TensorFlow)
- TensorFlow (for building the neural network)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning operations)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-recognition.git
   cd traffic-sign-recognition
