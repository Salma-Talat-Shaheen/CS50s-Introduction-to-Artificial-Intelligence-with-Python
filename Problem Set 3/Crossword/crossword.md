# Crossword Puzzle Generation Using AI and Constraint Satisfaction

To generate a crossword puzzle, we need to fill a grid with words from a given vocabulary list based on a predefined structure. This is modeled as a **constraint satisfaction problem**, where the variables are the words in the grid, and the constraints are related to word lengths and overlapping letters between neighboring words.

## Overview of the Problem:

### Crossword Structure:
A grid with defined positions for words. Each word has:
- **Start position** (row, column)
- **Direction** (either "across" or "down")
- **Length** (number of characters)

### Variables:
Each word to be placed in the grid is a variable that needs to be assigned a word from the list. The value of each variable must satisfy:
- **Unary constraints**: The word length must match the variable's length.
- **Binary constraints**: Overlapping letters between neighboring variables must be consistent.

### Objective:
Assign words to variables such that all constraints are satisfied, ensuring a valid crossword puzzle. All words must be distinct.

## Steps to Solve:

1. **Enforce Node Consistency**: 
   - Ensure each word in a variable’s domain satisfies the length constraint (matches the number of letters the variable requires).

2. **Revise Function**: 
   - Ensure that overlapping variables are consistent, meaning if two variables share a letter, that letter must be the same in both words.

3. **AC3 Algorithm**: 
   - Enforce **arc consistency** by ensuring that for every pair of overlapping variables, one variable's domain is consistent with the other.

4. **Check Assignment Completeness**: 
   - A crossword is complete when every variable is assigned a word.

5. **Check Consistency**: 
   - Ensure the assignment satisfies:
     - No repeated words.
     - Each word fits the required length.
     - No conflicts in overlapping letters.

6. **Order Domain Values**: 
   - Prioritize values in a variable’s domain based on how they impact neighboring variables (the least-constraining values).

7. **Select Unassigned Variable**: 
   - Use a heuristic to select the unassigned variable with the fewest remaining domain values and, if tied, the highest number of neighbors.

8. **Backtracking Search**: 
   - Use a **backtracking** approach to try assigning words to variables, backtrack if a conflict is found, and proceed until a valid crossword is generated or determined to be impossible.

This is the core logic for generating a crossword puzzle using AI and constraint satisfaction methods. The key challenge is to efficiently manage constraints and search the solution space.
