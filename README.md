This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the [CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) course by **Harvard University**.  
Throughout this course, I explored foundational AI concepts and implemented them using Python, covering areas such as search, logic, machine learning, and natural language processing.

## âœ¦ Projects Overview

| Project         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `Degrees`       | Find the shortest path between actors using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. |
| `Tic-Tac-Toe`   | Build an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax algorithm**. |
| `Knights`       | Solve logic puzzles using **propositional logic** and **model checking**. |
| `Minesweeper`   | Create an AI that plays Minesweeper using **logical inference**. |
| `Heredity`      | Calculate gene and trait inheritance probabilities using **Bayesian inference**. |
| `PageRank`      | Rank web pages using **link structure** and the **PageRank algorithm**. |
| `Crossword`     | Automatically generate crossword puzzles using **constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)**. |
| `Nim`           | Train an AI to play Nim using **Q-learning** (a type of **reinforcement learning**). |
| `Shopping`      | Predict shopping behavior using **Naive Bayes classification** on customer data. |
| `Traffic`       | Use a **Bayesian network** to predict traffic conditions. |
| `Attention`     | Implement a **transformer model** to summarize context using **self-attention mechanisms**. |
| `Parser`        | Parse sentences using **context-free grammar (CFG)** and extract **noun phrases** with NLTK. |
