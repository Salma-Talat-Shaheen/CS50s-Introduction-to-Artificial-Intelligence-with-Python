This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the [CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) course by **Harvard University**.  
Throughout this course, I explored foundational AI concepts and implemented them using Python, covering areas such as search, logic, machine learning, and natural language processing.
